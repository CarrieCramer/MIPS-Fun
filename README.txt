MIPS Fun:

This is a series of code snippets written in the MIPS32 assembly language. 

Various simple concepts are explored, such as nested loops, printing, string manipulation, and moving data back and forth between registers and memory. 

The QtSpim simulator was used to run and debug this program. 

This program was designed as a solution to an assignment for the Boston University course ENG EC413 (Fall 2014, Professor Herbordt).
